# Project Winter Multi-Hack

In most modern Unity games, the original C# Mono code is converted to C++ using their Il2Cpp tooling. While this brings a major boost in performance, it also means that reverse engineering these games became less noob-friendly. I made this project as a proof of concept and because I wanted to learn from it.

## Disclaimer
**This code is released for educational purpose only. It was made for fun during the holidays and I don't plan on updating it, it's easy enough to update the offsets. The code is pretty straight forward and I encourage you to use it to learn how to create hacks for Il2Cpp games and thus improving your reverse engineering skills.**
